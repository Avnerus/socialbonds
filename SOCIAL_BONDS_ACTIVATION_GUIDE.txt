SOCIAL BONDS - Activation
=========================

1. Turn on the projector
2. Turn on MacMini #1 - Check that 2 programs are up:
    A. mySketch - Showing a white square in the middle of a full black screen. 
            In case it does not show up on the full screen: Press ESC, start it again.
    B. Supercollider
    
3. Turn on MacMini #2 
4. Run camSketch, drag the window to the rightmost (smaller) screen. Choose Window->Fullscreen.
5. Run eyeSketch, drag the window to the left screen. Choose Window->Fullscreen.
6. On MacMini #1 - Press "P".


Troubleshooting
----------------

1. "P" - Didn't start the other screens:
    A. Make sure that you started mySketch _before_ starting eyeSketch and camSketch.
    
    B. When closing mySketch, one has to wait 1-2 minutes before starting it again, otherwise an error 
    might appear. Check data/log.txt, if it says something about port 9540 already bound, wait 2
    more minutes and then start it again.
    
    C. You can also check data/log.txt in camSketch and eyeSketch to see that they were connected 
    to the server.
    
2. mySketch is not full screen - Press ESC, wait 2 minutes, and start it gain. Then start eyeSketch and camSketch 
again.

3. One of the applications crashed (hopefully won't happen!) - Click to get the report with the full details
and stack trace, copy it and send it to Avner. Then restart the application. If it was mySketch that crashed, 
the other sketches need to be restarted as well.
